# AnimeMemoryGame

This game is a memory game that includes various anime characters.  

#Prerequisites
You will need java. I used eclipse for IDE

To run the program you will need to open up the GameBoard.java file and run. 

The game will first show all of the anime characters for 7 seconds. The cards will then flip over and you will see the balloon backside. 

The goal of the game is to match the correct anime character to its duplicate. Once you get a match the cards will disappear

Future Goals:
I want to implement this game with multiple players. 
I want to be able to have a clock that will time the person, making the game more 
challenging.
